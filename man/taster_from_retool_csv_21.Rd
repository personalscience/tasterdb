\title{Read notes from the iPhone app csv 2112 Version}
\usage{
taster_from_retool_csv_21(
  filepath = file.path(config::get("tastermonial")$datadir, "table-data-new.csv")
)
}
\value{
dataframe
}
\description{
The Tastermonial iPhone app sends each user scan to a database that I access
through Retool, a site that lets you download all user data as a single CSV file,
stored in the Tastermonial data directory as \code{table-data.csv}.  This function will read
that csv file and return a valid \code{notes_records} dataframe.
There's no need to correct for time zone because the Retool data is already
timestamped with UTC.
Important: Every food item read from Retool is converted into one of a limited number
of "experiment" types based on the transformation table called in \code{taster_classify_food()}
}
